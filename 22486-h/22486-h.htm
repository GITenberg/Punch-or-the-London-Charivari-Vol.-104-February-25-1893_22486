<p class="center">No. V.&mdash;AGRICULTURAL DEPRESSION.</p>

<p class="center">(<i>Scene and Persons as usual.</i>)</p>

<p><i>First Well-informed Man.</i> There hasn't been much in this
debate on the Addresses.</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> Oh. I don't know. They've promised a pretty
big list of measures. How they're going to find time for the lot I
can't make out.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> (<i>contemptuously</i>). Yes, that's always the way
with these Governments. They all talk mighty big at the beginning
of the Session, and then, at the end, they've done nothing, absolutely
nothing; at least, nothing that's any good to anybody. Parliament's
getting to be nothing but a bear-garden.
The House won't be a
fit place for a gentleman to be
seen in soon.</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> (<i>spitefully</i>).
You didn't seem to think it would
be such a bad place for one gentleman,
about eight months ago.
You were after a constituency
yourself, weren't you?</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> Well, and
what if I was? I told you at the
time why I thought of standing.
I thought I could do some good,
but I precious soon found they
were a miserable lot, so I made
'em my bow. "Gentlemen," I
said, "you can worry it out among
yourselves, and, when you've
agreed, you can let me know."</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> And they
never did let you know, did they?
Went and elected another Johnny.
Deuced bad taste I call it.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer</i> (<i>creating a diversion</i>).
Look here, I say, what's all this
talk about Agricultural Depression?
What does it mean?</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> What does it
mean! Why, my dear chap, I
should have thought that any
schoolboy knew that our agriculture
is being simply ruined. If
things go on like this, we shan't
have a farmer left. They're all
on the verge of bankruptcy.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer</i> (<i>doggedly</i>). I daresay
you're right; but, anyhow, I
know, when I was at Chilborough,
the other day, I saw a lot of
farmers about, and they looked
pretty fat and comfortable. That's
why I can't make out what it all
means.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> (<i>resignedly</i>).
Well, I suppose I must explain
it all, from the very beginning.
The first point is, we've got Free
Trade, and the farmers want
Protection; and old <span class="sc">Gladstone</span>
and all the rest of them say they're
not to have it. Well, that isn't
likely to put the farmers in a good
temper, is it? Then, of course,
the Americans, and the Russians, and the Indians see their chance,
and they send ship-loads of food into this country, and the taxes
have to be paid all the same by our farmers.</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> (<i>interrupting</i>). What taxes?</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> (<i>flustered</i>). I wish you wouldn't break in just as
I'm trying to make things clear. Why, the taxes on food, of
course.</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> There aren't any taxes on food.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> Oh, indeed! Well, then, how do you explain
Free Trade, and rent, and all that?</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> Now you're getting a bit nearer. It's all a
question of rent. Free Trade's got absolutely nothing to do with it.
What we want in this country is a Sliding-scale.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> What's a Sliding-scale?</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> (<i>taken between wind and water</i>). A Sliding-scale?
Let me see&mdash;it's very difficult to put these things shortly.
A Sliding-scale is a&mdash;&mdash;well, it's a sort of patent mechanical contrivance
for weighing out things, so as to make it fairer than
ordinary scales do. (<i>Plunges recklessly.</i>) You can make it slide up
or down, you know, and fix it at any point you like.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> Really! What a rum-looking thing it must be. Have
you ever seen one?</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> Oh yes. They've got two or three in every big
town.</p>

<p><i>Average Man.</i> When did you last see it?</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> (<i>suspiciously</i>). Oh, I haven't seen one for some
time. It <i>may</i> perhaps be a <i>little</i> different now.</p>

<p><i>Average Man.</i> Ah! [<i>A pause.</i></p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> I see the Government's going to have an inquiry about
Agricultural Distress. How are they going to work it?</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> Royal Commission, of course.</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> No, no. It's going to be a Select Committee.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> Well, what is
the difference?</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> Surely <i>you</i>
know that. They only have Royal
Commissions for labour and that
sort of thing. Committees don't
get any pay, you know.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> Of course. I ought
to have remembered that. But
who's this Lord <span class="sc">Winchilsea
and Nottingham</span>, who's cutting
about the country, talking about
agriculture! What does he know
about it? I don't seem to recollect
his name.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> He's a Peer.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> Yes, I know that;
but why do they call him Lord
<span class="sc">Winchilsea</span> <i>and</i> <span class="sc">Nottingham</span>?</p>

<p><i>Average Man.</i> Because that's
his name. [<i>A pause.</i></p>

<p><i>Inquirer</i> (<i>resuming</i>). But what
is he driving at?</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> He's got hold
of the right end of the stick.
It's just this way. (<i>To</i> Inquirer,
<i>who winces under the imputation</i>.)
You're a foreign country, and I'm
a British farmer. Well, you grow
your corn for nothing, and then
you chuck it into my markets.
Well, what I want to know is,
where do I come in? You may
call that Free Trade, if you like&mdash;I
call it ruin. The result is,
I'm smashed up, and the whole
country goes to the devil!</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> But you
ought to consider the consumer.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> What do you
mean by the consumer?</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M</i>. Why, myself,
for instance. I get the benefit
of it.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> Ah, you may
<i>think</i> you do, but you don't
really. In the end you've all to
pay more for everything.</p>

<p><i>Average Man.</i> Well, I'm pretty
happy as things are.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> Oh, of course&mdash;and
you'd let the land go
out of cultivation. That's mere
selfishness.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> How's that? Can't they work the land now?</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> What a question! Of course they can't.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer</i> (<i>anxiously</i>). But I've seen 'em ploughing a bit lately.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> My dear Sir, they do it just to occupy time&mdash;they
must do something.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> Of course&mdash;of course. [<i>Terminus.</i></p>

<p>Our amiable old friend, Mrs. R., came across a book entitled
<i>Playthings and Parodies</i>, by <span class="sc">Barry Pain</span>. "Oh, I <i>must</i> buy
<i>that</i>!" she exclaimed. "I've seen him so often in the Pantomime
at Drury Lane! And fancy his being an Author, too! But I
don't so much wonder at it, because I remember that, when I was
a little girl, there was a celebrated Shakspearian Clown at Astley's
called <span class="sc">Barry</span>, and he sailed in a tub drawn by geese down the
Thames, and there was a wonderful Pantomime actor of the name
of <span class="sc">Pain</span>. And now this talented gentleman turns out to be an
Author as well!!"</p>

that, even in the ordinary legislation
of the House, and still more in a
measure of such complexity, it was
the utmost folly to talk of finality!"&mdash;<i>Mr.
J. Redmond the Home-Rule
Bill.</i>]</p></blockquote>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Are our sage legislators, then, set upon finding</p>
<p>A measure that's "final, conclusive, and binding,"</p>
<p>As lawyer-phrase puts it? They might as well try</p>
<p>To fix dawn in the East, or nail clouds to the sky!</p>
<p>There's nothing that's "final" in infinite time,</p>
<p>That great, goalless, measureless race-course sublime?</p>
<p>In which relays of runners must keep up the race?</p>
<p>There's nothing "conclusive" in limitless space;</p>
<p>And "binding" man's soul to his best of to-day</p>
<p>For the future of growth, in an absolute way,</p>
<p>Were folly as futile as binding an oak</p>
<p>To the seedling's first prop, or the sapling's first yoke;</p>
<p>For provisional law, not for secular life,</p>
<p>Such phrases are fit. Yet to heal age-long strife</p>
<p>By the very best "betterment" now in our ken,</p>
<p>Till&mdash;a better shines forth's the first duty of men.</p>
<p>Do right to the height of our sight's actuality!&mdash;</p>

to such presumption myself. And, if I <i>did</i>, I <i>would</i> have a couple
of <i>entr&eacute;es</i>, and everything
carved <i>off</i> the
table! He'll go away
with such a poor opinion
of us all!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Bod.</i> He must
have noticed how the
vegetable dishes were
chipped! And I'm
sure I was ashamed to
see she had put out
those old-fashioned
doyleys with the finger-glasses.
I wonder she
never thought of getting
some new ones. I
saw some the other day
in the Grove, hand-worked,
at only five-pence
three-farthings!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Ditch.</i> I could
see <i>something</i> was
weighing on her mind,
or she'd have talked
more to him. What is
his title? It sounded
like "<span class="sc">Stratspoddle</span>."
I must look it out in my
Peerage. Would he be
an Earl now, or what?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Bod.</i> I don't
expect he's more than
a Viscount, if so much.
I do think she might
have <i>presented</i> us to
him, though!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Ditch.</i> It isn't
the fashion to introduce,
nowadays. But
I consider we are quite
entitled to speak to him,
if we get an opportunity&mdash;in
fact, he would
think it very odd if we
didn't! (<i>&amp;c., &amp;c.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Gilwattle.</i> Well,
<span class="sc">Maria</span>, I say, as I said
before, don't let it <i>turn
your head</i>, that's all!
Depend upon it, this
young nobleman isn't
so affable for nothing.
He wouldn't dine with
you like this unless he
expected to get <i>something</i> out of it. What that something may be,
you best know!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Tid.</i> (<i>to herself</i>). A guinea, at the very least! (<i>Aloud.</i>)
I'm sorry you think my head's so easily turned, Aunt <span class="sc">Joanna</span>!
If you'd noticed how I behaved to him, you wouldn't say so. Why,
I scarcely <i>spoke</i> to the man!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Gilw.</i> I was <i>watching</i> you, <span class="sc">Maria</span>. And sorry I was to see
that being next to a member of the nobility overawed you to that
extent you could hardly open your mouth. So unlike your Uncle
<span class="sc">Gabriel</span>!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Tid.</i> (<i>hurt at this injustice</i>). Overawed, indeed! I'm sure it
was no satisfaction to <i>me</i> to see him here! No, Aunt the only people
I welcome at <i>my</i> table are those in my own rank of life&mdash;relations
and old friends like you and the others. And how you can think
I was dazzled by a trumpery title when I sent him in with the
Governess&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Gil.</i> Ah, you make too much of that girl, <span class="sc">Maria</span>. I've
noticed it, and <i>others</i> have noticed it. She takes too much upon herself!
The <i>idea</i> of letting her forbid <span class="sc">Gwendolen</span> to recite&mdash;no wonder
your authority over the child is weakened! I should have <i>insisted</i>
on obedience.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Tid.</i> (<i>roused</i>). I hope I know how to make my own child obey
me. <span class="sc">Gwendolen</span>, come out of that corner. Put down your book.
(<span class="sc">Gwen</span>. <i>obeys</i>.) I wish you to repeat something to your Auntie&mdash;what
you refused to say downstairs&mdash;<i>you</i> know what I mean!</p>

<p><i>Gwen.</i> Do you mean the thing Miss <span class="sc">Seaton</span> said I wasn't to,
because you'd be angry?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Tid.</i> (<i>majestically</i>).
Miss <span class="sc">Seaton</span> had
no business to know
whether I should be
angry or not. She is
only your Governess&mdash;<i>I</i>
am your Mother. And
I shall be extremely
angry if you don't
repeat it at once&mdash;in
fact, I shall send you
off to bed. So you can
choose for yourself.</p>

<p><i>Gwen.</i> I don't want
to go to bed ... I'll
tell, if I may whisper it.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Tid.</i> Well, if
you are too shy to speak
out loud, you <i>may</i>
whisper. You see, Aunt,
I am not <i>quite</i> such a
cipher as you fancied!</p>

<blockquote><p>[<span class="sc">Gwen</span>. <i>puts her mouth

<p><i>Mr. Tid.</i> (<i>carefully
closing the door</i>). I only
just wanted to tell you
that I don't at all like
the way you've been
going on. It's not my

<p><i>Lord Strath.</i> (<i>hotly</i>).

Perhaps you'll kindly
let me know what you

<p><i>Mr. Tid.</i> Well, why
couldn't you say you
didn't smoke when my Uncle offered you one of his cigars? You
must have felt me kick you under the table!</p>

<p><i>Lord. Strath.</i> I did&mdash;distinctly. But I gave you credit for its being
accidental. And, if you wish to know, I said I smoked because I
do. I don't see why you should expect me to <i>lie</i> about it!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Tid.</i> I don't agree with you. I consider you ought to have
had more tact, after the hint I gave you.</p>

<p><i>Lord Strath.</i> It didn't occur to me that you were trying to kick
<i>tact</i> into me. And, naturally, when I saw your Uncle about to
smoke&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mr. Tid.</i> That was different, as you might have known. Why,
<i>one</i> cigar is as much as my wife can stand!</p>

<p><i>Lord Strath.</i> You&mdash;er&mdash;wouldn't wish her to smoke <i>more</i> than
one, surely?</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page89" id="page89"></a>[pg 89]</span><p><i>Mr. Tid.</i> (<i>outraged</i>). My wife smoke! Never did such a thing
in her life! She don't allow <i>me</i> to smoke. She wouldn't allow
Mr. <span class="sc">Gilwattle</span> if he wasn't her Uncle. And I can tell you, when
she comes down in the morning, and finds the curtains smelling of
smoke, and hears you were the <i>other</i>, I shall catch it!</p>

<p><i>Lord Strath.</i> Sorry for you&mdash;but if you had only made your kick
a trifle more explanatory&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mr. Tid.</i> That's not <i>all</i>, Sir. When you saw me and my Uncle
engaged in talking business, what did you cut in for with a cock-and-bull
story about the Boxing Kangaroo being formed into a
Limited Company, and say the Kangaroo was going to join the Board
after allotment? You couldn't really believe the beast was eligible
as a Director&mdash;an <i>animal</i>, Sir!</p>

<p><i>Lord Strath.</i> Why not? They have <i>guinea-pigs</i> on the Board
occasionally, don't they? But of course it was only a joke.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Tid.</i> You weren't <i>asked</i> to make jokes. My Uncle doesn't
understand 'em&mdash;no more do I, Sir!</p>

<p><i>Lord Strath.</i> No, I gathered that. (<i>Breaking out.</i>) Confound it
all, Sir, what do you mean by this? If you didn't want me, why
couldn't you tell me so? You knew it before <i>I</i> did! I don't understand
your peculiar ideas of hospitality. I've kept my temper as
long as I could; but, dash it all, if you force me to speak out, I
will!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Tid.</i> (<i>alarmed</i>). No, no, I&mdash;I meant no offence&mdash;you won't go
and let everything out now! It was a mistake, that's all&mdash;and there's
no harm done. You got your <i>dinner</i> all right, didn't you? By the
way, talking of that, can you give me any idea what they'll charge
me for this, eh? What's the <i>regular</i> thing now?</p>

<p><i>Lord Strath.</i> (<i>to himself</i>). Extraordinary little bounder&mdash;wants
me to price his dinner for him! (<i>Aloud.</i>) Couldn't give a guess!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Tid.</i> Well, considering I sent round and all that, I think they
ought to make <i>some</i> reduction&mdash;y'know. But <i>you</i>'ve nothing to do
with that, eh? I'm to settle up with <span class="sc">Blankley's</span>?</p>

<p><i>Lord Strath.</i> I should say he would prefer your doing so&mdash;but it's
really no business of mine, and&mdash;er&mdash;it's getting rather late&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mr. Tid.</i> (<i>opening the door</i>). There, we'll go up. And look here,
<i>do</i> try and be a bit stiffer with my Uncle. It's too bad the way he
goes on my-lording you, y'know. You shouldn't encourage him!</p>

<p><i>Lord Strath.</i> I wasn't aware I <i>did</i>. (<i>To himself.</i>) Trying, this.
But never mind, I shall see <span class="sc">Marjory</span> in another minute!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Tid.</i> (<i>to himself</i>). The <i>airs</i> these chaps give themselves! Oh,

<h2>SUGGESTIONS FOR RIDE PARK.</h2>

<p>"Many improvements," the <i>Daily News</i> writes, "in the arrangement
of the Parks in the West End" have been made. Have they?
Perhaps visible to the eye assisted by <i>Mr. Weller's</i> "pair o'
patent double million magnifyin' gas microscopes of hextra power."
But why, for the hundredth time we ask, and every equestrian asks
as well, why aren't rides made across Kensington Gardens from
Princes' Gate to Bayswater? Beautiful rides they would be under
the trees, and thus varying the wearisome monotony of the round
and round squirrel-in-a-cage sort of routine exercise, to which the
Rotten-Row Riders are purgatorially bound. Also, why not a ride
right across Hyde Park from the Achilles Statue to an exit facing
about Albion Street, Bayswater? What difficulties can there be
which a First Commissioner of Works representing an actively Liberal
and Progressive policy could not carry out for the benefit of the
Mounted Liver Brigade and the Light Cavalry?</p>

<h2>A BIG LION AMONG THE LITTLE 'UNS.</h2>

<p>"Daniel in the Lions' Den" will occur to many on reading how
<span class="sc">Henry Irving</span> ventured into and actually dined as the distinguished
guest of a society styling itself "The Playgoers' Club." But
after all, whether these were real leonine cubs, or only "lions
stuffed with straw," the Real Lion of the evening was the Daniel
come to Judgment, <span class="sc">Henry Irving</span>, who, having partaken of the
"chicken and champagne," and acknowledged the goodness thereof,
gave them the less smooth side of his own tongue with charming
frankness.</p>

<p>"I do not hesitate to tell you," purred the Lion, sweetly, "that
there have been times when the genius of frankness which possesses
the Club"&mdash;he did not allude to the existence among them of any
other sort of genius&mdash;"has not appeared to be allied with the
finest discrimination. (<i>Laughter.</i>)"</p>

<p>Yes&mdash;the poor little Lions laughed&mdash;it was all they could do,
unless they had whimpered, and promised not to offend again.
It must have been a delightful evening. To what other banquets
will our leading Histrion be invited? To the Pittites' Club
Dinner? To the Wreckers' Banquet? Will he be entertained
by the Dissentient Gallery-Boys' Club, and finish up with a
supper strictly confined to the upper Circles' Society? Instead of
"Give your orders, Gents&mdash;the Waiter's in the room!" of old
days, the Chairman will probably advise the enterprising Playgoers
to "Ask for 'orders,' Gents&mdash;the Manager's in the room." However,
if these heaven-born dramatic critics occasionally hear a few
words of good advice from so honest a guest as <span class="sc">Henry Irving</span>, such
gatherings may perhaps serve some useful purpose.</p>

<p class="center">(<i>Intended for the use of courteous Members of Parliament.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Question.</i> I trust you quite acknowledge that strong language is

<p><i>Answer.</i> Quite, especially when a compensating description can be
found for every suitable term of abuse.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> You grasp the idea. How would you describe <span class="sc">Nero</span> fiddling
during the burning of Rome?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> I should say that he was a musician with a turn for pleasing
variations.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Very good. And how would you speak of <span class="sc">Guy Faux</span> on the
eve of blowing up the House of Commons?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> An experimentalist who would have been a useful lecturer
upon chemistry at the Royal Institution.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> And could you refer to <i>Blue Beard</i> after the discovery of the
cause of his last widowerhood without giving offence?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Yes; as a married man who objected on principle to the
Mormon practice of being wedded to more than one wife at a time.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Yes. And what would you say of <span class="sc">Marie de Medicis</span>, who is
reported to have fired at the Huguenots from the Louvre?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> I should say that her late Majesty took such an interest in
field sports, as nowadays would have secured her election to the
Gun Club.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> And, lastly, were you asked to describe <span class="sc">Henry the Eighth</span>
after he had slaughtered most of his wives, plundered all the monasteries,
and imprisoned or executed many of his subjects, what would
you call him?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Without hesitation I should refer to him as "an excited
politician."</p>

<h2>A DOLE-FUL PROSPECT.</h2>

<p><i>Easter.</i>&mdash;Wonder what the effect of the
<span class="sc">Bishop's</span> appeal to the "loyal laity," to come
down heavily with Easter Offerings to the
Clergy, will be? Rather an exciting day for
me. Hard-up is not the word for my condition
at present. Can't keep myself, and
have to keep a Gardener and a Curate!</p>

<p>A lot of cast-off clothes arrive from "<span class="sc">A
Sympathetic Parishioner</span>!" How degrading!
Wish <span class="sc">Bishop of Worcester</span> hadn't
said that he knew a Clergyman who stayed
in bed because he had no decent clothes to
wear. Congregation seem to think he meant
<i>me</i>! Two blankets, and a rig-out of "Cellular
under-clothing," from "<span class="sc">Church Defence</span>,"
addressed to "Our Beloved but
Impoverished Incumbent." Quite insulting!
Give blankets to Gardener, and send the
Cellular things to Curate, as his tendencies
are distinctly monastic.</p>

<p>Letter from a Newmarket Bookmaker!
Says he hears I'm in want of Easter Offerings,
so he offers to "put me on to a good thing for
the Derby." I am, apparently, to forward
him a £5 note, and he returns me £50
"without fail." Tempting, but haven't got
a £5 note to send.</p>

<p>Arrival at my quiet Vicarage of a donkey,
a cow, two pigs, and a dozen barndoor
fowls! Perhaps, in honour of the pigs, I
might call this a "sow Easter!" The whole
menagerie sent by neighbouring farmers.
Wish they'd send me arrears of rent for
glebe instead; yet I daren't ask for them.
Evidently intended as Easter "gifts in
kind;" but not the kind I want. Send
donkey on to Curate, and tether cow in back-yard,
not having a field. Pigs temporarily
accommodated in back kitchen. Cook
threatens to give notice.</p>

<p>Church. Offertory goes to <i>me</i> to-day!
Don't half like it. Feel like a schoolboy
expecting to be tipped. Curate rather glum.
Finds he thinks my sending the donkey to
him was meant to insult him. When I assure
him it wasn't, he cheers up, and says he'll
hold the plate. Does so. Seems very heavy.
Curate distinctly winks at me, which is
against the Rubrics, no doubt, but still
seems to be an augury of happy tidings about
the sum collected. On his way to Vestry,
Curate whispers to me "Two-fifty!" What
does he mean? Is it two fifty pounds, or
shillings? It's neither&mdash;it's <i>pence</i>! Really,
if this is all the "loyal laity" can do, I may
as well disestablish myself.</p>

<p>Best Easter Offering of all comes by post.
Offer of position as Under-Cashier in a firm
of eminent Bone-boilers. Write to accept
offer with thanks. Better to boil bones for
other people than to have all the flesh taken
off my own.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page94" id="page94"></a>[pg 94]</span><h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

<p class="center">EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</p>

<p><i>House of Commons, Monday, February 13.</i>&mdash;House filled from
floor to topmost range of gallery. Terrible rumour that it is also
peopled underneath. Members sitting on two front benches
evidently restless through opening passages of Mr. G.'s speech.
Weird whispering heard, apparently rising from boots of <span class="sc">First Lord</span>
of the <span class="sc">Treasury</span>. <span class="sc">Grandolph</span> pricks up his ears; fancies he
recognises voice familiar in Harley Street. First thought, whispered
commentary must come from Ladies' Gallery. Right Hon. Gentlemen
look up, and conclude it is too remote. Besides, Ladies <i>never</i>
talk in the Gallery.</p>

<p>"Moreover than which," said <span class="sc">Fergusson</span>, staring stolidly at
open network of iron floor, "it comes from quite different quarter."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:60%;"><a href="images/094.png"><img width="100%" src="images/094.png" alt="" /></a><h3>GENTLEMEN OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS TAKING THEIR SEATS, MONDAY, FEBRUARY 13, 1893.</h3></div>

<p>Even Mr. G., absorbed as he was with great topic, evidently
noticed the odd state of things, for towards end of magnificent
speech he dropped his voice right down through the grating into the
chamber below, so that Strangers in distant Gallery lost the purport
of his words. Above-board&mdash;or rather above iron grating&mdash;House
presented spectacle worthy of occasion. Last time anything like it
seen was in April, 1886, when first Home-Rule Bill introduced.
Singularly like it this afternoon, with chairs blocking the floor
in fashion to which <span class="sc">Lord-Chamberlain</span>, looking down from Peers'
Gallery, admitted he would not permit in any other theatre. Side-galleries
filled; Members thronging Bar, sharing the steps of
<span class="sc">Speaker's</span> Chair, peeping round from behind its recess, sitting on
the Gangway steps. The Lords' Gallery thronged, with somewhat
disorderly fringe of Viscounts jostling each other on the steps. Not
an inch of room to spare in the Diplomatic Gallery, whilst happy
strangers rose tier beyond tier on the benches behind. Over the
clock H.R.H., <i>debonnaire</i> as usual, able to extract fullest pleasure
and interest out of passing moment. By his side, his son and heir;
not the one who sat there on the April night nine years ago, but the
younger brother, with Cousin <span class="sc">May</span> facing him through the <i>grille</i> of
Ladies' Gallery. Many other gaps filled up on floor of House, the
biggest those created by the flitting of <span class="sc">Bright</span> and <span class="sc">Parnell</span>.</p>

<p>The figure at table answering to Speaker's call, the "<span class="sc">First Lord</span>
of the <span class="sc">Treasury</span>" is the same, though different. Marvellously
little different, considering all that has passed since '86, and remembering
the weight of added years when they come on top of fourscore.
Scantier the hair, paler the face and more furrowed; but the form
still erect, the eye flashing, the right hand beating vigorously, as of
yore, on the long-suffering box; the voice even better than it was
for a certain period towards close of 1880 Parliament; the mental
vision as clear; the fancy as luxuriant; the logic as irresistible;
the musical swing of the stately sentences as harmonious. For two
hours and a quarter, unfaltering, unfailing, Mr. G. held the
unrivalled audience entranced, and sat down amid a storm of
cheering, looking almost as fresh as the posy in his button-hole.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Mr. G. introduces Home-Rule Bill.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;<span class="sc">Colonel Saunderson</span> going about to-day just as if
nothing had happened yesterday. <i>But something did.</i> Little misunderstanding
arose in connection with appropriation of a Seat. The
Colonel, of course, in the row at the door of the House, between
eleven and noon. Two hundred Members waiting to get in as soon
as doors opened. "Nothing like it seen in civilised world since the
rush for Oklahoma," says Lord <span class="sc">Playfair</span>, who has been in the
United States. "Then, you remember, the intending settlers,
gathering from all parts, bivouacked on line marked by military,
and on appointed day, at fixed hour, at sound of gun, made the
dash into the Promised Land. Lack some of those particulars here.
But the passion just the same; equally reckless; every man first,
and the Sergeant-at-Arms take the hindmost."</p>

<p><span class="sc">Playfair</span> himself came down two hours later, intending to take
his seat in Peers' Gallery, but, finding another mob at entrance,
almost as turbulent, concluded he would not add to the tumult by
wrestling with anybody for a place in the front rank. So, meeting
a Bishop, who had come down with similar intent and abandoned
endeavour from analogous reason, they went for a walk in the Park.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Saunderson</span> not a man of that kind. Thoroughly enjoyed himself
for exciting three-quarters of hour. Was in first flight of heated
and dishevelled senators who crossed the Bar when door flung open,
and elderly Messenger was simultaneously flattened at back of it.
<span class="sc">Saunderson</span> dropped on to first convenient seat; folded his arms;
beginning to view the scene when, like the person in the pastoral
poem, "he heard a voice which said,"&mdash;"You're sitting on my hat!"</p>

<p>"Well," replied Colonel, genially recognising Irish Member of
same Province, but another faith, "now you mention it, I thought I
did hear something crunch." On examination, found remains of hat.</p>

<p>"Come out of my seat!" said the other Ulster man.</p>

<p>"Not at all," said the Colonel.</p>

<p>"Then I'll take you!" said the Ulster man.</p>

<p>"Do so," said the Colonel. Ulster man seized Colonel by collar
and coat, and tugged violently. Rest of conversation was carried on
with the Ulster man lying on his back, at full length, partly under
his seat. "There was no hat here when I arrived," said the Colonel.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page95" id="page95"></a>[pg 95]</span><div class="figright" style="width:60%;"><a href="images/095.png"><img width="100%" src="images/095.png" alt="" /></a><h3>MR. PUNCH'S HISTORICAL CARTOONS. MR. G.'S ROOM IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.</h3></div>

<p>"Then how did it get there?" said the Ulster man, under the
seat.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page96" id="page96"></a>[pg 96]</span>
<p>"That's for you to explain," said the Colonel, politely assisting
Ulster man to rise. "If, when a gentleman is taking his seat,
an Hon. Member places his hat upon it, accidents will happen."</p>

<p>Ulster man threatens to bring question under notice of <span class="sc">Speaker</span>.
"Begad, I hope he will," said the Colonel, smiling grimly. "If
you know the gentleman, <span class="sc">Toby</span>, tell him I'll keep him in hats
through Leap Year if he'll only do it. I should like to give the
House an unadorned narrative of the incident. <span class="sc">John Roche's</span>
deer-stealing story would be nothing to it."</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Debate on Home-Rule Bill.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;<span class="sc">Grandolph</span> back again at old post on Front Opposition
Bench. All the Parliamentary world gathered to greet him. H.R.H.
in old familiar seat over clock, whence, up to Monday, his pleasant
presence had long been missed. Not a seat vacant on
floor of House. Galleries crammed, whilst, through <i>grille</i>
of Ladies' Gallery, bright eyes rained influence. <span class="sc">Grandolph</span>
had arranged to resume Debate on Home-Rule
Bill; should have come on bright and fresh as soon as
questions were over. Meanwhile sat on Front Opposition
Bench, awaiting the signal to dash in. Incessantly
playing with beard, in fashion that testified to
high state of nervousness.</p>

<p>Everything excellently planned, the man, the hour,
and the surroundings. Only thing forgotten was the
dog&mdash;dog, you know, that has a little place down at
Epsom, and turns up on course just as the ranged horses
are straining at the bit, and the flag is upheld for the
fall. On this occasion, Irish dog, of course. Introduced
in artfullest way. <span class="sc">Esmonde</span>, mildest-mannered man
that ever whipped for Irish party, casually, as if he
were inviting him to have a cigarette, asked <span class="sc">Wolmer</span>
across House whether it was true that he had called
Irish Members "forty paid mercenaries"? <span class="sc">Wolmer</span>, an
equally well-dressed, civil-spoken young man, smilingly
admitted that it was quite true he had couched a remark
in the terms quoted, but had certainly not meant anything
offensive to Irish Members. Indeed, general aspect
of noble Lord, and his tone, suggested feeling of surprise
that <span class="sc">Esmonde</span> and his friends should not rather have
felt complimented by the observation challenged.</p>

<p>This turned out to be polite crossing of swords before
duel to the death, a shaking of hands before deadly
set-to without gloves. <span class="sc">Sexton</span> suddenly dashed in,
and, with back-handed stroke at <span class="sc">Wolmer</span>, went for
the <i>Times</i> who had adopted and improved upon the
Viscount's genial remarks. Assault admirably planned;
carried on with irresistible vigour, sweeping down
earlier resistance of <span class="sc">Speaker</span>. Showed what <span class="sc">Sexton</span>
can do when so deeply moved as to forget himself, and
resist besetting temptation to play the fatal windbag.</p>

<p>An hour-and-half's tussle all round House; at end
Irish held the field, and, without dissentient voice, <i>Times</i>
article declared to be "gross and scandalous breach of
privileges of House."</p>

<p>But the hour and half had passed, and with it <span class="sc">Randolph's</span>
chance of supreme success. House of Commons,
though greedy for excitement, will never stand two doses
in quick succession. After scene like that, which to-night
filled House with fire and smoke, anything that follows is anti-climax.
It was a cruel fate, which <span class="sc">Grandolph</span> bore uncomplainingly,
and fought against with quiet courage. Painfully nervous
when he broke the silence of two years, the still crowded House had
difficulty in catching his opening sentences. But, as he went on,
he recovered himself, and regained mastery over an audience
evidently eager to welcome his permanent return to position of old
supremacy.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;The Wanderer returned. Slow music. Air&mdash;"<i>Come,
Kill the fatted Calf.</i>"</p>

<p><i>Saturday</i>, 12:50, <span class="sc">A.M.</span>&mdash;Mr. G. just brought in Home-Rule Bill,
amid ringing cheers from Ministerialists, who rise to their feet, and
wildly wave their hats as <span class="sc">Premier</span> passes to table. Been some
effective speaking on this last night of Debate. <span class="sc">Chamberlain</span>,
<span class="sc">Blake</span>, and <span class="sc">John Morley</span>, each excellent in varied way. Only
few Members present to hear <span class="sc">Bodkin</span> insert maiden speech in dinner-hour.
A remarkable effort, distinguished, among other things, by
necessity of <span class="sc">Speaker</span> twice interposing, second time with ominous
threat that <span class="sc">Bodkin</span> could not be tolerated much longer. <span class="sc">Bodkin</span>,
resuming thread of his discourse, humbly apologised, kept his eye
(<span class="sc">Bodkin's</span> eye) warily on <span class="sc">Speaker</span>, and, when he saw him preparing
to rise for third time, abruptly resumed his seat,&mdash;returned
hurriedly to the needle-case, so to speak,&mdash;and thus avoided worse
things.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Home-Rule Bill read a First Time.</p>

<hr />

<h2>REAL "DIPLOMACY."</h2>

<p>No doubt of it! A great diplomatic stroke on the part of
Mr. <span class="sc">John Hare</span> is this revival of <i>Diplomacy</i>&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, <span class="sc">Sardou's</span> <i>Dora</i>
in an English-made dress&mdash;at the Garrick Theatre. An unequivocal
success (of which more "in our next") on Saturday night for everybody;
and, after the Play was over, the audience, inspired by
"the gods," called Mr. and Mrs. <span class="sc">Bancroft</span> before the curtain.
Mrs. <span class="sc">Bancroft</span>, in the course of an admirable little speech, said,
"If I stood here till next week, I should not be able to express all I
feel." Now as, by the right time, it was exactly 11:54 <span class="sc">P.M.</span> <i>Saturday
night</i>, this clever lady would certainly <i>not</i> have been able in the
time to express all she felt, or to say all she would have liked to say,
seeing there were only six minutes left before "next week" began.</p>

all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

Gutenberg-tm License.

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
